**Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark Project**

*Objective*

This project aimed to capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark to gain an understanding of the various types of network packets and protocols. The goal was to simulate network traffic using Kali Linux, capture it with Wireshark, and analyze the different packets and their associated protocols to better understand how data flows through a network.

*Skills Learned*

-Analyzed network traffic and protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS) using Wireshark.

-Applied filters to isolate specific traffic types (e.g., HTTP, DNS, TCP/UDP).

-Developed an understanding of network protocols and their role in data communication.

-Practiced using Wireshark's tools to follow streams, analyze packet capture files, and understand their structure.

Tools Used

-VirtualBox â€“ Hosted virtual machine running Kali Linux to simulate network traffic.

-Kali Linux: Used for generating traffic and analyzing captured data.

-Wireshark: Analyzed and captured network traffic.

*Steps*

1. Set Up Virtual Environment: Configured a virtual machine with Kali Linux in VirtualBox to simulate network traffic.
2. Generate Network Traffic: Generated network traffic through browsing, pinging, and other network activities on the Kali Linux VM.
3. Capture Traffic with Wireshark: Opened Wireshark on Kali Linux to capture network packets and monitor the network interface.
4. Filter Traffic: Applied display filters in Wireshark to isolate specific packets based on protocols like HTTP, DNS, and TCP.
5. Analyze Packets: Inspected the captured packets to understand key packet elements such as source/destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
6. Review Traffic Flow: Observed how data flowed between devices, paying attention to the structure and sequence of network communication.
